# SMOKE_P18 - Waterline Contours

1. Load a model with vertical walls (e.g. samples/sample_part.stl).
2. Choose a finishing tool and set *Strategy* to Waterline (AI will suggest automatically for steep features).
3. In **Toolpath Settings**:
   - Set *Max Depth/Pass* to .75 mm so multiple Z levels are required.
   - Ensure the cutter type is Flat Endmill to exercise XY offsetting.
4. Generate the toolpath (without OCL, the console should log Waterline slicer generated ..., with OCL it logs OCL waterline generated ...).
5. Inspect the preview: each Z level should appear as a closed loop tracing the part boundary, with rapid linking generated by the machine-safe logic.
6. Export or simulate to confirm the first moves stay within the constant-Z contours and rapids honour safe/clearance heights.
